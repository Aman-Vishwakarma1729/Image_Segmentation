 ## IMAGE SEGMENTATION
 
 * Image segmentation is a commonly used technique in digital image processing and analysis to partition an image into multiple parts or regions, often based on the characteristics of the pixels in the image.
 * Image segmentation could involve separating foreground from background, or clustering regions of pixels based on similarities in color or shape.

## QUADTREE  BASED  IMAGE  SEGMENTATION

* Quadtrees are a type of tree data structure where each node in the tree has four children.
* What’s special about quadtrees is that they’re used for partitioning(dividing) two-dimensional space into smaller sub-spaces. These sub-spaces or nodes in the tree hold some kind of spacial information. These nodes also have a threshold for that information and once it’s met it will further divide into four more subspaces.
